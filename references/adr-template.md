# ADR Template

Use this template when producing ADRs in `docs/adr/`. Filename format: `YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-<title>.md` where NNN is a globally sequential number (check `docs/adr/` for the next available number).

Use RFC 2119 MUST / MUST NOT / SHOULD / SHOULD NOT / MAY language in the Requirements section. Include a mermaid diagram if the ADR has three or more components with two or more relationships, or at least one state machine.
